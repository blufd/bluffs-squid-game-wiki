                        <p>In Red Light, Green Light, he witnessed the first deaths of many players. He then saw Player 275 push Player 150, causing Player 150 to be eliminated. This infuriated Player 197, so he went to avenge Player 150. He fought Player 275 and successfully eliminated him.</p>

                        <p>He grabbed a bottle and, with his buddy (Player 218), went to the men's bathroom to hide. However, there was already someone there, and Player 218 began attacking another player who entered. The people in the bathroom were hostile, leading to Player 197 and Player 218 sustaining many injuries while brawling with several others. In the last 10 seconds of Lights Out, Player 218 made the mistake of running out of the bathroom. He was jumped by other players because he was so injured, making him an easy target and resulting in his death. This deeply affected Player 197.</p>

                        <p>In Mingle, he was supposed to be eliminated in the first round. There were 8 people (when only 3 were needed per group), and Player 197 grouped up with Player 312 to head to a room. They entered a room thinking there were three of them, but the other group of three went to the door next to theirs. Player 197 and Player 312 were devastated, as the other group found a door as well. Player 312 accepted his fate, but Player 197 went outside and closed the door on him. He confronted the guards face-to-face before the timer ended, grabbed a guard's MP5, and shot several guards. He then grabbed magazines and another MP5. He quickly ran back to his door and gave Player 312 the second MP5. They fought off the guards together, and since the door was bulletproof, the guards couldn't do much. The guards evacuated the other 6 players and held the door. Player 197 and Player 312 kept fighting but eventually ran out of ammo. They surrendered, but the guards shot them anyway.</p>
